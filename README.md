# Marvel Universe Explorer

Hello and welcome! Marvel Universe Explorer is a fun and interactive web-based project that lets you dive into the amazing world of Marvel. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project retrieves data from the Marvel API to showcase characters, comics, and creators. You can easily navigate between sections to explore details about your favorite Marvel heroes, iconic comic issues, and the creative minds behind them.

## Inspiration

When I was little, I find myself drawn into the Marvel Universe—a world of heroes, villains, and incredible stories that sparked my imagination. Creating the Marvel Universe Explorer site is my way of sharing that excitement, letting others dive into these iconic characters and their stories.

## Features
